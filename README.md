# coopy
Stay cooped up in your comfortable terminal.

download the executable, place it in a directory such as `~/.local/bin`, and then call it when you want to manage some language toolchains

update the language versions downloaded by going into `download.nim` and changing the links to updated ones, then rebuilding the app

rebuild by running `nim c src/main.nim`
